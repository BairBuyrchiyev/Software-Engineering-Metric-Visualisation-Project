# Software Engineering Metric Visualisation Project

This program gives data by probing the GitHub REST API for data such as how many repositories a user has, and which languages a user's repositories contains.  
Unfortunately, I could not fully fix the problems that my program has with displaying the pie chart of languages, it works flawlessly on the initial user, and then stays bugged throughout.
